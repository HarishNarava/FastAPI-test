# FastAPI Test

Testing FastAPI

## what it does
- basic hello world endpoint
- about page that says it's a test
- that's pretty much it for now

## run these in terminal
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt for the dependencies

# and then

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see it work

## endpoints
- `/` - says hello world
- `/about` - test message
- `/docs` - automatic documentation

this is just for testing
